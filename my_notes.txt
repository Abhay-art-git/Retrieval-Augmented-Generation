Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
It allows systems to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, and problem solving.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that uses data and algorithms to improve performance.
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks to process large amounts of data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
Applications of NLP include chatbots, translation systems, and sentiment analysis.

ChromaDB is a vector database used to store embeddings. Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
LangChain is a framework that helps connect language models with external knowledge sources like databases and APIs.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method where an LLM retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base before generating an answer.

Key points:
1. AI → ML → DL (hierarchy of concepts)
2. NLP enables human-computer communication
3. ChromaDB stores embeddings for semantic search
4. LangChain builds pipelines for RAG
5. RAG improves accuracy by combining retrieval + generation
