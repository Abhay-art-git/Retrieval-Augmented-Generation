## About The Project

**[Your Project Name]** bridges the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and your private knowledge base. Standard LLMs have a knowledge cut-off and can't access your proprietary documents. This RAG model overcomes that limitation by first retrieving relevant information from your provided data and then using an LLM to generate a human-like, context-aware answer.

This project was built to [mention your motivation, e.g., "provide a simple framework for developers to build custom Q&A bots," or "explore advanced RAG techniques"].

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Bring Your Own Data:** Supports various file types (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`, etc.).
-   **Vector Database Integration:** Uses [e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone] for efficient similarity search.
-   **Choice of LLMs:** Easily switch between models like OpenAI's GPT, Hugging Face models, etc.
-   **Modular Design:** Clean and separated logic for data ingestion, retrieval, and generation.
-   **Easy to Deploy:** [Mention if you have Docker support or a simple API, e.g., "Comes with a simple FastAPI for easy integration."]

## 🏛️ Architecture

The model follows a standard RAG pipeline:

1.  **Data Ingestion & Indexing:** Documents are loaded, chunked, and converted into vector embeddings. These embeddings are stored in a vector database for fast retrieval.
2.  **Retrieval:** When a user asks a query, it's embedded into a vector. The system then performs a similarity search in the vector database to find the most relevant document chunks.
3.  **Generation:** The original query and the retrieved context are passed to an LLM, which generates the final, context-aware answer.

    A[User Query] --> B{Embed Query};
    C[Documents] --> D{Load & Chunk};
    D --> E{Embed Chunks};
    E --> F[(Vector Database)];
    B --> G{Similarity Search};
    F --> G;
    G -- Relevant Context --> H{Prompt Augmentation};
    A -- Original Query --> H;
    H --> I[LLM];
    I -- Generated Answer --> J[User];
